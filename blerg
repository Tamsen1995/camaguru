git add -A

git commit -m "[UPD] The activation works just fine now. But I need to figure out how to hash the passwords and
get those to work with the activation. And then I need to implement the login et cetera. also whenever a user signs up 
the signup page doesn't change at all which is a problem. I've made a js script so that the page would
scroll back up to the top but that doesn't seem to properly work for some reason. Needs FIXING!"
